            We are a group of concerned Ontarians who can no longer stand by as our province is led
            into a humanitarian crisis. We believe the power of storytelling is an effective means
            to drive government action.

              It is clear that our government will not listen to numbers or scientific evidence.
              Data might be easy to dismiss but stories, and the human connection they spark, cannot
              be ignored.

              Many doctors, business owners, essential workers and concerned Ontarians have already
              spoken up and shared their stories, but many are fearful and donâ€™t feel they have a
              voice; there are too many stories still left to be told.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              We created MyCovidStory as a way to amplify every voice that wants to share - with
              government leaders, the media or the public - regardless of whether they have their
              own platform or not.

              We believe the stories speak for themselves, and will use them to engage
              decision-makers to drive effective government policy and the adoption of science-based
              practices that will save lives.
