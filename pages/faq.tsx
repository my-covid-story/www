            Why does this website exist?
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            The site was created to help any individual in Canada impacted by
            the COVID-19 pandemic — from factory workers and family members to
            business owners and physicians — to easily and safely share their
            stories so that they can be seen by decision-makers, media and the
            public.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            These stories highlight the need for a pandemic response and
            recovery that promotes physical, emotional and economic well-being,
            and offer insight into how certain neighbourhoods, populations,
            institutions and industries are uniquely affected. By amplifying
            them, we hope to emphasize the human element of the pandemic to
            encourage compassion and understanding of the experiences of others.

            Anyone over the age of 18 can submit their story. While our initial
            focus was on Ontario, we now welcome stories from anyone throughout
            Canada.

            We are a group of concerned individuals who could not stand by as
            parts of our country were led into a humanitarian crisis. We believe
            the power of storytelling is an effective means to emphasize the
            human element of the pandemic, encouraging compassion amongst the
            Canadian public and offering first-hand insight to decision-makers
            and the media.
